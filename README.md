✅ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
📝 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.

Returns the calculated factorial.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

📤 Expected Output
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:

The factorial of 5 is: 120




✅ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
📝 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Asks the user for a number as input.

Uses the math module to calculate:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e)

Sine of the number (in radians)

Displays the calculated results.

📤 Expected Output
For example, if the user enters 25, the output should look like:

Square root of 25: 5.0  
Natural logarithm of 25: 3.2188758248682006  
Sine of 25 (radians): -0.13235175009777303
